Docker is a containerization platform that packages software applications, including libraries and other dependencies, and runs them in a virtual environment in an efficient manner. The rise of containerization and further implementation of containers is one of the key improvements we've seen in the world of software development.

Docker aims to add value to organizations by offering a container platform that improves developer productivity, increases application speed and deployment, offers additional security and more.


## My thoughts on Docker

Docker is a valuable piece of software that has helped many organizations over the years and will continue to be widely used and improved as time goes on. I'm still learning Docker by going through tutorials and researching it online, but I plan to understand it in great detail so that I can add it to my toolkit and knowledge base. There is a good chance I'll be using it at some point while working on a team, so it behooves me to learn as much as I can while I continue my studies.
