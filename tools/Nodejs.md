# Node.js

Node.js is an asynchronous JavaScript based run-time environment that allows you to build a wide variety of web applications and web servers. Node is designed to build scalable network applications with its event driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.


My Thoughts on Node.js

JavaScript is everywhere these days when it comes to modern websites and web applications. With Node.js, you can utilize JavaScript across the full stack. I think it's important as a web developer to understand how JavaScript is used on both the front-end as well as the back-end. I started learning JavaScript along with HTML and CSS while studying front-end web development, but quickly became interested in what Node.js could do for server side JS applications and implementations.

Since so many companies and web projects now rely on Node.js for server side development, I think it is an important tool to learn and add to your toolkit.
