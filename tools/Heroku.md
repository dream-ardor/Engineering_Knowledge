**What is Heroku?**

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps while bypassing infrastructure headaches. Heroku focuses on apps and the developer experience around apps by letting companies of all sizes embrace the value of apps, not the distraction of hardware, nor the distraction of servers - virtual or otherwise.

With a special focus on supporting customer-focused apps, it enables simple application development and deployment. Since the Heroku platform manages hardware and servers, businesses that use Heroku are able to focus on perfecting their apps â€” and not  the infrastructure that supports them. More time goes towards ensuring that users receive the highest quality experiences as possible.
