# **What is Heroku?**

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps while bypassing infrastructure headaches. Heroku focuses on apps and the developer experience around apps by letting companies of all sizes embrace the value of apps, not the distraction of hardware, nor the distraction of servers - virtual or otherwise.

With a special focus on supporting customer-focused apps, it enables simple application development and deployment. Since the Heroku platform manages hardware and servers, businesses that use Heroku are able to focus on perfecting their apps â€” and not  the infrastructure that supports them. More time goes towards ensuring that users receive the highest quality experiences as possible.


## My thoughts on Heroku

I had already heard of Heroku well before actually trying it. As a web developer with an eye towards the best and fastest technology, I'm always researching and looking for new and innovative tools to add to my repertoire. Part of that is of course looking at the best resources for deploying and hosting my websites and web applications. I had used Github Pages and Netlify before using Heroku and found it to be unique with its own pros and cons.

For hosting static web sites and small projects, Github Pages and Netlify are great. But Heroku has more functional backend support for your web apps, whereas Netlify and Github pages are more geared towards front-end web development. I hosted my first Ruby on Rails project on Heroku and found it to be a fairly easy process.
